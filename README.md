Hello There ! This is a test actually so don't worry
(Idk why you would worry tho)

# Ideas for Khodok.xyz

- Why not instead of including all the elements, just making a normal page with always the same elements and add the CONTENT - using PHP instead?
- I can have a $mainTitle variable (in the include page, not in the main one) that changes depending on which page is called - and then it changes the main h1
- the header would always be the same
- footer same
- head same, but some things can change depending on which page we're on (like title tag)
- etc
